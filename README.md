# Getting started

- create a binance account and generate an api key:
https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/360002502072

- update the configs from `src/config/config.ts`

# Buying

- `yarn buy`
- if you run `yarn buy -d` it'll show you what to buy, but won't buy anything

# Selling
- `yarn sell`
- or if you want only to show what'll be sold without selling `yarn sell -d`

# Hackers
Even if you find out the api key/secret for binance you won't be able to withdraw
funds. Trust me, someone already tried :(
